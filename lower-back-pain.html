      <h2>When yoga can help (and when to pause)</h2>
      <p>These poses are designed for common stiffness and mild, non-specific low back discomfort. If you have sharp pain, numbness/tingling, pain shooting down the leg, recent injury, fever, or loss of bladder/bowel control, pause and seek medical advice first.</p>

      <h2>8 gentle yoga poses for lower back pain</h2>

      <h3>1) Cat–Cow (spine mobility)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Start on hands and knees. Inhale, gently arch your back and lift your chest (Cow). Exhale, round your spine and tuck your chin (Cat). Repeat slowly.</p>
      <p><strong>Modify:</strong> If wrists hurt, place forearms down or make fists.</p>

      <h3>2) Child’s Pose (back + hip release)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Kneel, bring big toes together, knees apart, and fold forward. Rest your forehead on the floor or a pillow. Breathe into your lower back.</p>
      <p><strong>Modify:</strong> Put a pillow under your chest if folding feels too intense.</p>

      <h3>3) Sphinx Pose (gentle back extension)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your belly, prop up on forearms, elbows under shoulders. Keep hips on the floor and lengthen through the crown of your head.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This is mild. If it increases back pain, skip it.</p>

      <h3>4) Supine Knee-to-Chest (low back decompression)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your back. Hug one knee in toward the chest for 20–30 seconds, then switch. Keep the other leg bent or extended—choose what feels best.</p>
      <p><strong>Modify:</strong> Hold behind the thigh if grabbing the shin is uncomfortable.</p>

      <h3>5) Supine Twist (spine + glute stretch)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your back, knees bent. Drop both knees to one side while keeping shoulders relaxed. Breathe 20–40 seconds, then switch.</p>
      <p><strong>Modify:</strong> Put a pillow between knees or under knees for support.</p>

      <h3>6) Figure-4 Stretch (piriformis / glute)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your back, cross right ankle over left thigh. Either stay here or thread hands behind the left thigh and gently draw it in. Switch sides.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Tight glutes can pull on the lower back and add strain.</p>

      <h3>7) Bridge Pose (core + glute strength)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your back, knees bent, feet hip-width. Press feet down and lift hips slightly. Keep ribs relaxed and avoid over-arching.</p>
      <p><strong>Beginner cue:</strong> Think “lift and lengthen,” not “bend hard.”</p>

      <h3>8) Reclined Hamstring Stretch (posterior chain)</h3>
      <p><strong>How:</strong> Lie on your back, loop a towel around the foot and gently straighten the leg toward the ceiling until you feel a stretch behind the thigh.</p>
      <p><strong>Modify:</strong> Keep the knee slightly bent if hamstrings are tight.</p>
